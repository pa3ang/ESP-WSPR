Version 1.7  2025-12-22
  - made calibration routine available now without rebooting (same as band config) and possibility to cancel out.
  - improved testloop to cancel out true the webinterface and redirect to / (root).
  - improved save & reboot in config screen to refresh after 15 seconds to / (root).
  - random frequency offset -50 to +50 Hz to stay of the center frequency but well within the 200 Hz bandwidth.
  - commented out the 10MHz stabilization on clk2 as this influences WiFi connectivity.

Version 1.6
  - added more bands to FEX version 12 in total now 160 - 2 meter

Version 1.5
  - choice of display type between SSD1306 and SH1106.
  - improved selection of used PCB.
  - BIAS reintroduced on Pin D8. 
  - improved interval of transmissions: 
      Interval given by the user is used to calculate the next transmission after finalizing a complete cycle.
      If only one band is active this counts also a completing the cycle. 
      During the cycle no interval is used meaning that all bands are following directly after each other on the next even minute.  
  - cleanup of some unused code.

Version 1.4
  - changed claibration literals and removed .1 and .01 Hz steps 
  - improved valid date and time checking at TinyGPS startup


Version 1.3
  - removed bandmask
  - created proper band configuration into the sketch stored in EEPROM and supported with a webpage
  - changed void loop() for new band config and fixed frequency table
  - changed void tester() to apply given band config
  - LPF can handle the hardware version of PA3FBX with 3 pins and LPF 1, 2 and 3 individual Connected
      and PA3FEX version with 4028 multiplexer assuming LPF number from 1-7  (0b000 - 0b110 on lpfPins) with a possible 7 LPF assembled.
      LINE 221 HAS >>>>  #DEFINE REDUCED_LPF_HW   WHICH NEEDS TO BE COMMENT OUT IF THE PA3FEX PCB IS USED
  - fixed frequency table has all band frequency on the center of the WSPR band. but due to the fact that the Si5351 is not GPS locked
      the frequency will deviate around the center given the environment temperature the unit is in.
  - improved and cleanup some code

Version 1.2
  - changed gps/wifi routines 
    1. if gps is enabled in configuration (default) then program will try to lock and get the time from the gps and update the locator
          and if the gps is ok the program will create an AP to serve the configuration webpage on host ESP-WSPR IP: 192.168.4.1 
    2. if no gps or no lock the WiFimanager will try to login to the given SSID network
          and if done it will run the NTP routine and start a webservers on the assigned local IP address.
    3. if no network connection established the program will create a captive page on ESP-WSPR 192.168.4.1 to cature the 
          SSID and password. Therafter it will resync.
  - changed pin assignments D5 and D7 vor LPF

Version 1.1
  - Added dloading default values when EEPROM has not ben used before
  - corrected maidenhead.h library name
  - improved calibration html page
  - improved comments
  - some cosmetic code changes

Verion 1.0
Modified and improved script from ESP_WSPR sketch from PD0GB and PA3FBX
  - Web interface for configuration panel
  - Calibration also via the web interface
  - SSD1306 info panel texts completely revised
  - Extra debug messages via Serial
  - WSPR interval configurable via the web interface
  - SI5351 CLK2 fixed at 10 MHz continuously for stabilization
  - Warmup period removed 
  - Cleanup of unused code and variables
  - GPS support on PIO D3 (can conflict during boot / reset)
  - Read locator from GPS when GPS is enabled

Using a WM-386 (an ESP6288 clone variant).
With this, we can build a WSPR transmitter with:
  - Up to 3 bands with LPF switching (d5, D6, D7)
  - Use the buildin led - D4 PIO for indicating Webinterface active
  - Use a TinyGPS on PIO D3 
  - Time Sync using NTP
  - Provide a configuration possibility through WiFi accessable webwerver

Time synchronization is selectable via WiFi NTP server or optional GPS.

Hardware: Wemos D1 Mini, Si5351 module, 128x64 I2C OLED display, a few LEDs (optional)  

On first startup, if no WiFi credentials are stored, the ESP will switch into Access Point mode.  
SSID = "WSPR_ConfigAP"  no password.  

Connect your phone/laptop to this network the captive portal is available at 192.168.4.1  
A configuration page appears after can enter or select the avilable WiFi SSID and enter the password.
Click “Save”. The ESP will then connect to your local WiFi.  
 
The unit will restat an show the local WiFi IP adress on the SSD1306 screen during booting.
Log in through your home network to enter the WSPR credetials and parameters:
  - Callsign
  - Locator
  - dBm (output power setting)
  - Calibration factor  (update through calibration routine)
  - Transmission interval in minutes after start of message or cycle
  - GPS enable/disable
  - Band mask x y z selecting 40 meter, 20 meter, 10 meter or multiple
  - GPS enable
  - OLED rotate
  - Reset WiFi - set to 9 to reseter the local WiFi SSID and Password 
You can also switch the unit into Calibration or Testloop.
