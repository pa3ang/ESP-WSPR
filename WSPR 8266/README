  - corrected maidenhead.h library name
  - improved calibration html page
  - improved comments
  - some cosmetic code changes

Verion 1.0
Modified and improved script from ESP_WSPR sketch from PD0GB and PA3FBX
  - Web interface for configuration panel
  - Calibration also via the web interface
  - SSD1306 info panel texts completely revised
  - Extra debug messages via Serial
  - WSPR interval configurable via the web interface
  - SI5351 CLK2 fixed at 10 MHz continuously for stabilization
  - Warmup period removed 
  - Cleanup of unused code and variables
  - GPS support on PIO D3 (can conflict during boot / reset)
  - Read locator from GPS when GPS is enabled

Using a WM-386 (an ESP6288 clone variant).
With this, we can build a WSPR transmitter with:
  - Up to 3 bands with LPF switching (d5, D6, D7)
  - Use the buildin led - D4 PIO for indicating Webinterface active
  - Use a TinyGPS on PIO D3 
  - Time Sync using NTP
  - Provide a configuration possibility through WiFi accessable webwerver

Time synchronization is selectable via WiFi NTP server or optional GPS.

Hardware: Wemos D1 Mini, Si5351 module, 128x64 I2C OLED display, a few LEDs (optional)  

On first startup, if no WiFi credentials are stored, the ESP will switch into Access Point mode.  
SSID = "WSPR_ConfigAP"  no password.  

Connect your phone/laptop to this network the portal is available at 192.168.4.1  
A configuration page appears after can enter or select the avilable WiFi SSID and enter the password.
Click “Save”. The ESP will then connect to your local WiFi.  
 
The unit will restat an show the local WiFi IP adress on the SSD1306 screen during booting.
Log in through your home network to enter the WSPR credetials and parameters:
  - Callsign
  - Locator
  - dBm (output power setting)
  - Calibration factor  (update through calibration routine)
  - Transmission interval in minutes after start of message or cycle
  - GPS enable/disable
  - Band mask x y z selecting 40 meter, 20 meter, 10 meter or multiple
  - GPS enable
  - OLED rotate
  - Reset WiFi - set to 9 to reseter the local WiFi SSID and Password 
You can also switch the unit into Calibration or Testloop.
